# Say Their Names ✊🏿

## Overview

Welcome to the Say Their Names project. Our aim is to build an open-source platform that raises awareness of the injustice and often forgotten names of racial inequality at the hands of law enforcement. We strive to identify and amplify verified organizations to ensure donations are reaching those who can make the most impact with it.

If you would like to support the project, use or pass around this DigitalOcean referral link: [DigitalOcean Referral Link](https://m.do.co/c/c6f8950155bf).
When someone uses this link to sign up for DigitalOcean, they get $100 in credit over 60 days. Once they’ve spent $25, we'll get $25 in credits that we can use for paying for the servers.

## Contributing

**We heartily welcome any and all contributions that match our engineering standards!**
That being said, this codebase isn't your typical open source project because it's not a library or package with a limited scope—it's our entire product.
